# Bookmarking Application

I normally don't post tutorials on my github account, I try to keep this to only projects I do on my own, and not projects where I'm following along.  However, I was doing Brad Traversy's bookmarking application tutorial and I veered from the path a few times, by inserting jQuery and using ES6 syntax.  I knew most of how to do the tutorial before going in, I just didn't know much about using local storage.

The tutorial can be found on his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIVfDZZeGxM).

I normally would not use jQuery for such a small project, but I decided to go for it for the hell of it.
